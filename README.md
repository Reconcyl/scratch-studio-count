# scratch-studio-count

If a Scratch studio has more than 100 projects, it just says 100+ on the studio webpage.
This means that it is not convenient to get the number of projects... until now!
This is a simple script that will tell you EXACTLY how many projects are in a studio,
using the site-api.
